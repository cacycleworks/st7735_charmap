st7735_charmap
==============

A character map display pager for Adafruit 1.8 TFT Joystick shield with ST7735 driver.

All of the characters are displayed in rows of 15 with 0-9a-f along the top and the "tens" hex down the left side; 0x10, 0x20, etc. You can page through the thousand-odd characters Adafruit gave us. There are some great ones! Solid arrows, normal arrows, lots of greek characters, and a few international sets. 

Use the 1.8TFT's onboard joystick to page through the entries. 

This code would (should) work on any TFT, however the pager input will need to be changed (probably to the serial, etc).
